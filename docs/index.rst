Welcome to BIPES Help&Development, here is all information about the BIPES code base,
alongside with tutorials to get started!


What is BIPES?
-----------------

BIPES stands for Block based Integrated Platform for Embedded Systems.

It was conceived and created from our experience of many years developing and teaching embedded systems and Internet of Things applications. BIPES allows anyone to quickly and reliably design, program, build, deploy and test embedded systems and IOT devices and applications. It is fully based on a web environment, so absolutely no software install is needed on the client / developer machine. In that way, a tablet, a netbook, a Chromebook or any other device can be used to program and test several devices.

All programming is done using blocks, which is faster and safer than traditional coding, and a recognized trend. IEEE Spectrum, for example, discusses the advantages of "programming without code" in the article Programming Without Code: The Rise of No-Code Software Development.


What is new?
